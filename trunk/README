AUTO-IWCONFIG

auto-iwconfig is a tool that allows the user to define so called profiles 
for iwconfig that can be changed.

To change to your current 'home' profile (if you had set up one) you could simply type

auto-iwconfig home

and SSID, encryption key, etc.. will be adjusted automatically.

auto-iwconfig is controlled with the file

~/.auto-iwconfig.conf

which holds the profiles configuration. The aforementioned 'home' profile could read:

[home]
interface=wlan0
essid=homenetwork

Note that the 'interface' option is mandatory, as one profile can only be assigned to one wlan interface.
